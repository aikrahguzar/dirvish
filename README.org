#+html: <p align="center"><i>A minimalistic yet versatile file manager based on</i> <b>Dired</b></p>

* Introduction

This package gives Dired the following features:

+ Multiple window layouts
+ Always available file preview
+ Isolated sessions
+ A modern and composable user interface

... to name a few.

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

* Quickstart
** Installation

Dirvish is available on [[https://melpa.org][Melpa]], you can install it directly via ~package-install~
if you have melpa in your ~package-archives~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; For straight.el user
(straight-use-package 'dirvish)

;;; Manual install
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dirvish")
;; If you want the extensions as well
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dirvish/extensions")
(require 'dirvish)

;; It is recommended to enable `dirvish-override-dired-mode', which makes
;; Dirvish to take over Dired globally.  This is not required, but why not?
(dirvish-override-dired-mode)
#+end_src

** Basic usage

Start a full frame Dirvish session by =M-x= ~dirvish~.

Start a single window Dirvish session by =M-x= ~dired~ | ~dired-jump~ | ... (make sure
~dirvish-override-dired-mode~ is enabled).

~dirvish-toggle-fullscreen~ allows you to toggle the fullscreen state of the
current session.

That's it, you're all set. Use Dirvish in the same as you use Dired.

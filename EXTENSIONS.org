* Extensions

Several small extension packages to Dirvish are maintained in the subdirectory
extensions/. They are installed together with Dirvish if you pull the package
from MELPA, Dirvish can work properly with or without them though. These
extensions are inactive by default and can be enabled manually if desired.

Currently the following extensions come with the package:

- [[file:extensions/dirvish-menu.el][dirvish-menu.el]]: Keybindings help menu powered by =transient.el=.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-yank.el][dirvish-yank.el]]: Multi-stage copy/pasting of files.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-peek.el][dirvish-peek.el]]: Preview files when narrowing candidates using minibuffer.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-vc.el][dirvish-vc.el]]: Version-control (git) integration for Dirvish.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-extras.el][dirvish-extras.el]]: Extra commands, UI elements, preview dispatchers for Dirvish.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-side.el][dirvish-side.el]]: Toggle Dirvish in side window like [[https://github.com/jaypei/neotree][neotree]].
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-fd.el][dirvish-fd.el]]: =fd= command interface in Dirvish.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-subtree.el][dirvish-subtree.el]]: Like =dired-subtree.el=, but simpler and faster.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-history.el][dirvish-history.el]]: History navigation commands for Dirvish.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-bookmark.el][dirvish-bookmark.el]]: Bookmark support for Dirvish.

With these extensions it is possible to adapt Dirvish such that it matches your
preference or behaves similar to other familiar file explorers.

** Transient based help menu (dirvish-menu.el)

This extension provides help menu powered by =transient.el= for Dirvish.

~dirvish-dispatch~ is the prefix to invoke the top-level help menu, just like
~magit-dispatch~ as to =magit= (see Figure 1. in [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/#screenshots][README.org]]). The menu contains most
of the built-in Dired commands and all of the Dirvish commands. Some sub-level
prefix commands such as ~dirvish-marking-menu~ were created because it makes sense
to group together the Dired/Dirvish commands that serve similar purposes.

An interesting prefix worth mentioning is ~dirvish-setup-menu~, because it enables
users to change the setup of a session on the fly (See *Figure 6* and *7* in this page).

The variable ~dirvish-menu-available-prefixs~ holds all available prefixs, bind
them in ~dirvish-mode-map~ if you like.

** Multi-stage copy/pasting of files (dirvish-yank.el)

Here is a quote from [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-ranger]] that justified the ~dired-ranger-move/paste~ commands:

#+begin_quote
A feature present in most orthodox file managers is a "two-stage" copy/paste
process. Roughly, the user first selects some files, "copies" them into a
clipboard and then pastes them to the target location. This workflow is missing
in dired.

In dired, user first marks the files, then issues the dired-do-copy command
which prompts for the destination. The files are then copied there. The
dired-dwim-target option makes this a bit friendlier---if two dired windows are
opened, the other one is automatically the default target.

With the multi-stage operations, you can gather files from multiple dired
buffers into a single "clipboard", then copy or move all of them to the target
location.
#+end_quote

The ~dirvish-yank~ command can do similar things as ~dired-ranger-move/paste~,
meanwhile, it has serveral benefits over ~dired-do-copy~ or ~dired-ranger~:

- It paste/move files using external processes, hence heavy I/O tasks won't
  block the main process of Emacs.
- It's much simpler than ~dired-ranger~ because you mark files using built-in
  Dired commands such as ~dired-mark~, ~dired-mark-extension~.
  
** Minibuffer file preview (dirvish-peek.el)

~dirvish-peek-mode~ gives you a preview window when narrowing file candidates
using minibuffer. It displays file preview for all of the file name narrowing
commands in the same way as =dirvish= command.

The ~dirvish-peek-display-alist~ option allows you to control the window placement
of the peek window.

~dirvish-peek-mode~ currently supports =vertico=, =selectrum=, =ivy= and =icomplete[-vertical]=.

** Version-control (git) integration (dirvish-vc.el)

|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Attribute | Description                                     |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~vc-state~  | A VC state indicator (such as "M" for modified) |
| ~git-msg~   | Show git commit messages after the file name    |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|

This extension also provides the ~vc-diff~ preview dispatcher which shows changes
between the working tree and the index of selected files at preview window.

** Toggle Dirvish in side window (dirvish-side.el)

** 'fd' interface in Dirvish (dirvish-fd.el)


This is the BEST =fd= frontend, period.

Here is a quick demo.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16313743/170814774-98cc598d-6bc5-4fc3-9eea-21c98d6d4772.mp4

Too fast? Let's break it down:

1. M-x ~dirvish-fd~, input /test/ as the search pattern and confirm
2. Oh, too many results. How about some additional filtering?
3. M-x ~dirvish-fd-switches-menu~
4. Press =f= (show file onlyï¼Œno directories)
5. Press =-e=, input "/py,yaml/", meaning search for these 2 extensions only
6. Press =-E=, input "/Emacs/", exclude the glob in the results
7. Press =RET=, refresh the results

Wait, there's more: ~dirvish-quicksort~ and ~dirvish-ls-switches-menu~ also works
for this buffer.

*** Commands

** Turn Dirvish into a tree browser (dirvish-subtree.el)

This extension gives Dirvish the ability to toggle a directory as subtree
(~dirvish-subtree-toggle~), which can be seen as a stripped-down version of
=dired-subtree=. Unless you need ~dired-subtree-up~ and friends, you don't have to
install the =dired-subtree= package.
